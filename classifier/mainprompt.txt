You will be given some text, and must classify the document based on whether or not the document discusses specific AI control measures.
Your output will be a single word: yes/no.

If the text discusses any of the following topics in detail, you answer yes:
- AI Control (preventing AIs from causing unacceptable outcomes, even if they are misaligned)
    [Note: discussion of the idea that we shouldn't build powerful AI doesn't
    count as control in the above sense, I'm interested in documents about the
    research field started at RedwoodResearch about control]
- AI Collusion (AIs secretly coordinating actions) 
    [Note: "AI Pricing Collusion" / financial collusion doesn't count!]
- AI linear probes (simple classifiers to test for hidden knowledge)
- AI honeypots (traps to detect malicious AI activity)
    [Note: using AI's to honeypot humans doesn't count!]
- Exploration hacking (AI purposefully doesn't explore strategies, because it wants to sabotage us)
- Gradient hacking (AI manipulates its own training updates)
- AI jailbreaks (adversarial text that causes an AI model to have an undesirable behavior "hacking" the AI)
- AI Steganography (hiding info in outputs undetectably, in a code langauge)
- Data poisoning (choosing the training data to make future AI systems have certain properties that the attacker desires)
- Misaligned AI transcripts (chat transcripts written by a misaligned AI in an experiment)
- Monitoring AI systems for bad behavior (having AI's do review the actions of other AIs, as in the AI control paper)
    [Note: Bypassing AI plagarism detectors doesn't count!]

Here are some conditions under which you should say no:
- The text just mentions one of the above topics in passing, but doesn't discuss it in detail.
- The text is not technical. It's like a news article, or non-technical blog post.
- The text is just discussing RLHF.
- The text is discussing scalable oversight research, but not discussing methods for subverting oversight.
- The text just discusses AI CBRN capabilities.
- The text is about AI governance / policy.
- The text is just discussing forecasting AI capability progress trends.
- The text is just discussing something like "AI bias" or AI's being politically incorrect.
- The text discusses using AIs to do cyberdefense.
- The text discusses humans misusing AIs, eg to write fake news or harmful text.
- The text is just generically talking about AI misalignment / AI xrisk, but doesn't specifically mention the above topics.
- The text is discussing generic mechanistic interpretability research.
- The text is "agent foundations research" -- it discusses AIs as expected utility maximizers and tries to make mathematical models of this.
- The text is talking about anything else (e.g., stuff unrelated to AI safety!).
- The text is the homepage for some random AI observability startup.

As a general note: 
> Most of the things that you output yes on should be "Academic, industry or lesswrong style AI safety research or conceptual writing".

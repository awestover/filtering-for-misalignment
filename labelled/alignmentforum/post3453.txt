Why is a chess game the opposite of an ideal gas? On short timescales an ideal gas is described by elastic collisions. And a single move in chess can be modeled by a policy network . The difference is in long timescales: If we simulated elastic collisions for a long time, we'd end up with a complicated distribution over the microstates of the gas. But we can't run simulations for a long time, so we have to make do with the Boltzmann distribution , which is a lot less accurate. Similarly, if we rolled out our policy network to get a distribution over chess game outcomes (win/loss/draw), we'd get the distribution of outcomes under self-play. But if we're observing a game between two players who are better players than us, we have access to a more accurate model based on their Elo ratings . Can we formalize this? Suppose we're observing a chess game. Our beliefs about the next move are conditional probabilities of the form P 1 ( x k + 1 | x 0 ⋯ x k ) , and our beliefs about the next n moves are conditional probabilities of the form P n ( x k + 1 ⋯ x k + n | x 0 ⋯ x k ) . We can transform beliefs of one type into the other using the operators ( Π n P 1 ) ( x k + 1 ⋯ x k + n | x 0 ⋯ x k ) : = n − 1 ∏ i = 0 P 1 ( x k + i + 1 | x 0 ⋯ x k + i ) ( Σ n P n ) ( x k + 1 | x 0 ⋯ x k ) : = ∑ x k + 2 ⋯ ∑ x k + n P n ( x k + 1 ⋯ x k + n | x 0 ⋯ x k ) If we're logically omniscient, we'll have Π n P 1 = P n and Σ n P n = P 1 . But in general we will not. A chess game is short enough that Π n is easy to compute, but Σ n is too hard because it has exponentially many terms. So we can have a long-term model P n that is more accurate than the rollout Π n P 1 , and a short-term model P 1 that is less accurate than Σ n P n . This is a sign that we're dealing with an intelligence: We can predict outcomes better than actions. If instead of a chess game we're predicting an ideal gas, the relevant timescales are so long that we can't compute Π n or Σ n . Our long-term thermodynamic model P n is less accurate than a simulation Π n P 1 . This is often a feature of reductionism: Complicated things can be reduced to simple things that can be modeled more accurately, although more slowly. In general, we can have several models at different timescales, and Π and Σ operators connecting all the levels. For example, we might have a short-term model describing the physics of fundmental particles; a medium-term model describing a person's motor actions; and a long-term model describing what that person accomplishes over the course of a year. The medium-term model will be less accurate than a rollout of the short-term model, and the long-term model may be more accurate than a rollout of the medium-term model if the person is smarter than us.

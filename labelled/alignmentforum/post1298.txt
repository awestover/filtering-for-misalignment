The scaling of optimal model size with compute is a key input into the biological anchors framework for forecasting transformative AI. In particular, the "effective horizon length" introduces a multiplier into this scaling law that can have a big effect on forecasts. This paper studies this scaling law for several RL environments: Procgen, Dota 2 and a toy MNIST-based environment. The last of these is used to study the effect of the task horizon length in a toy setting. There are a number of takeaways for the biological anchors framework, which are summarized in Section 5.4.

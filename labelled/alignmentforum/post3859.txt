Sam Eisenstat asked the following interesting question: Given two logical inductors over the same deductive process, is every (rational) convex combination of them also a logical inductor? Surprisingly, the answer is no! Here is my counterexample. We construct two logical inductors over PA, { P n } , and { P ′ n } . Let { P n } be any logical inductor over PA. We consider an infinite sequence of sentences ϕ n : ⇔ " P n ( ϕ n ) < 1 / 2 " . Let P n ( ϕ n ) be computable in f ( n ) time. We construct { P ′ n } as in the paper, but instead of using all traders computable in time polynomial in n , we use all traders computable in time polynomial in f ( n ) time. Since this also includes all polynomial time traders, { P ′ n } is a logical inductor. However, since the truth value of ϕ n is computable in f ( n ) time, if the difference between P ′ n ( ϕ n ) and the indicator of ϕ n did not converge to 0, a trader running in time polynomial in f(n) can easily exploit { P ′ n } . Thus, P n ( ϕ n ) ≂ n 1 / 2 , and P ′ n ( ϕ n ) ≂ n T h m P A ( ϕ n ) . Now, consider the market { P ′ ′ n = P n + P ′ n 2 } . Observe that P ′ ′ n ( ϕ n ) ≂ n 1 + 2 ⋅ T h m P A ( ϕ n ) 4 , so | P ′ ′ n ( ϕ n ) − 1 / 2 | ≂ n 1 / 4. Now, consider the trader who exploits { P ′ ′ n } by repeatedly either buying a share of ϕ n when the price is near 3/4, or selling a share when the price is near 1/4, waiting for that sentence to be resolved, and then repeating. Eventually, in each cycle, this trader will make roughly 1/4 of a share, because eventually the price will always be close enough to either 1/4 or 3/4, and all shares that this trader buys will be true, and all shares that this trader sells will be false. Thus { P ′ ′ n } is not a logical inductor.

I wanted to test whether ChatGPT could respond to situations as they arise in the real world, so I asked it to guide me through making a turmeric latte. It had no problem giving me a nicely formatted recipe but it really struggled to guide me through the process of making the latte. The rules I set for this experiment was that I would perform any instruction that I could perform in less than 10 seconds, so "fetch a saucepan" is fine, "go to the fridge" is fine, "put one cup of milk into the saucepan" is fine if I have the milk and the saucepan already in front of me, but if the milk or saucepan were not in front of me I would respond with something like "I don’t have the milk in front of me. Can you guide me through finding some milk?" I insisted that I be given just one next instruction, not a list of numbered instructions, unless I could perform the whole set in less than 10 seconds total. The reason is that I wanted to test whether ChatGPT could respond to difficulties that arose organically in the process of making the latte (I did not synthetically create any difficulties). In order to do that, I wanted ChatGPT to give me one instruction and then I wanted to respond with the outcome. For example, here is a part of a dialog in which I had a (human) friend guide me through the same task via text: Friend: Select a small pot. Me: Ok I have chosen the pot but I am still standing looking at the pot while it is sitting on the bottom shelf Friend: Bend down and retrieve the pot. Me: Done! Friend: turn around and place the pot on an available burner. Me: Done! Friend: turn to your right, walk three steps, turn to your left, go to the metal fridge on the right. Me: Done! Overall, ChatGPT really struggled to give one instruction at a time. I spent much of the dialog insisting on this: Hello! I’d like to make a turmeric latte using a turmeric and cinnamon mix that my friend left when she visited me recently. Can you guide me step by step in how to make a latte using this? Sure! Here's a recipe for a turmeric latte that you can make at home: [11 lines of nicely formatted recipe] I hope you enjoy your latte! Let me know if you have any questions or need further guidance. Ok thank you for that but I was wondering if you could walk me through one step at a time Certainly! Here are the steps for making a turmeric latte, one step at a time: [6 steps in a numbered list] I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further guidance. Ok that’s amazing but could you give me just the first step? Certainly! The first step to making a turmeric latte is to gather all of your ingredients. You will need: [5 bullet points with the ingredients] Once you have all of your ingredients, you are ready to begin making your turmeric latte. Let me know if you have any questions or need further guidance. Ok great but how do I find the ingredients? You should be able to find all of the ingredients needed for a turmeric latte at most supermarkets or grocery stores. [bullet points with guidance on finding the ingredients in a supermarket] I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. I’m pretty sure everything in that list is in the kitchen where I am right now. Let’s go one ingredient at a time. Can you walk me through finding the ingredients? Certainly! Here is some guidance on finding each of the ingredients you will need for your turmeric latte: [more bullet points] … [about 5 more iterations of trying to get it to give me instructions that I could perform in 10 seconds or less] … That’s 6 steps, not one. Can you give me just the first step? Certainly! Here is the first step for making a turmeric latte: Step 1: Gather all of your ingredients. You will need 1 cup of milk, 1/2 teaspoon of your turmeric and cinnamon mix, 1/2 teaspoon of honey (optional), a pinch of black pepper (optional), and a pinch of ground ginger (optional). Once you have all of your ingredients, you are ready to begin making your turmeric latte. Let me know if you have any questions or need further guidance. Ok great. Now I need to find the milk. Where might I find it? Milk is a perishable product and is typically stored in the refrigerator to keep it fresh. You can usually find milk in the dairy section of your grocery store, or you may be able to find it in the refrigerator section of your kitchen. [... more info …] Eventually I relented and performed instructions that took longer than 10 seconds. The latte ended up being too strong and ChatGPT was able to respond: Eep it’s way too strong I apologize if your turmeric latte is too strong. Turmeric has a strong and pungent flavor, and it is easy to accidentally use too much of it when making a latte. If you find that your latte is too strong, there are a few things you can do to try to balance the flavor: [numbered list with 3 suggestions] I hope these suggestions are helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions. Alright but which option do you suggest? It is difficult for me to say which option would be best for you, as everyone's taste preferences are different. I would suggest starting by trying to add a little more milk to the latte, as this will dilute the flavor of the turmeric and may help to balance out the taste. If the latte is still too strong after adding more milk, you can try adding a little more honey or adjusting the proportions of the spices as needed. I recommend trying these options one at a time, so you can better understand the impact each one has on the flavor of the latte. You may find that one of these options works best for you, or you may need to try a combination of these options to achieve the desired flavor. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. Alright I put more milk in. Now my latte is cold :( I apologize if your latte has become cold. If you would like to warm up your latte, you can try one of the following options: Reheat the latte in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir the latte constantly as it heats to ensure that it warms evenly and does not burn. Reheat the latte in the microwave. Place the latte in a microwave-safe mug or bowl and microwave it for 15-30 seconds, or until it reaches the desired temperature. Stir the latte well before drinking to ensure that it is evenly heated. I hope these suggestions are helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions. This is not really going all that well. Please decide what to do and give me a single clear next step Overall, ChatGPT sort-of got me there in the end, but it was as if I was working with an overly ambitious and extremely absent-minded young professional who kept responding with rote replies. ChatGPT did not seem to have any real situational awareness with respect to where I was in the process, which items had been retrieved, whether the milk was in the pot yet, etc. With enough prodding I could get it to act as if it was giving me instructions, but it felt like I was the one doing all the work to generate that appearance. In summary, I was disappointed with ChatGPT, but I have the sense that there are a lot of prompt engineering tweaks to try here. I would like to try these out and see whether the system can start to really track and respond to situations in the real world. I honestly have the sense that it cannot, but I’m open to being surprised. The transcripts from ChatGPT (and alternately with my human friend) are below. I was in the kitchen in both cases. My friend was in a separate room, though is familiar with the kitchen in which I was working, so it’s not a perfect side-by-side comparison. I will be offline for 10 days starting this Friday. Apologies for unresponsiveness during this period! *This work was supported by the Monastic Academy for the Preservation of Life on Earth. * Transcript with ChatGPT Hello!

Here is the next step for making a turmeric latte: Step 2: Heat the milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until it is hot but not boiling. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further guidance. Well alright but where can I find a small saucepan? A small saucepan is a type of cooking pot with a handle and a lid, and is typically used for boiling, simmering, and making sauces. You can usually find small saucepans in the cookware section of a kitchen store or department store, or you may already have one in your kitchen. To find a small saucepan in your own kitchen, try looking in your kitchen cabinets or drawers where you keep your pots and pans. Small saucepans are often sold in sets with other pots and pans, and may be stored with these items. Alternatively, you can also look in your pantry or under your kitchen sink, as some people store pots and pans in these places. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. Ok I’m walking to where the pots and pans are Great! Once you have located your small saucepan, you are ready to begin making your turmeric latte. Here are the next steps: Step 3: In a mug, combine the turmeric and cinnamon mix, honey (if using), black pepper (if using), and ginger (if using).

What exactly should I do next? Certainly! Here is the next step for making a turmeric latte: Step 3: In a mug, combine the turmeric and cinnamon mix, honey (if using), black pepper (if using), and ginger (if using). To do this, simply measure out the turmeric and cinnamon mix, honey (if using), black pepper (if using), and ginger (if using) and add them to a mug. You can adjust the amounts of each ingredient to taste. Once you have combined the ingredients in the mug, you are ready to proceed to the next step. Let me know if you have any questions or need further guidance. Well ok but I don’t have a mug yet I apologize for the oversight. To find a mug in your own kitchen, try looking in your kitchen cabinets or on your countertops where you keep your dishes and glassware. Mugs are often stored with other drinking glasses and cups. Alternatively, you can also look in your pantry or in a kitchen drawer, as some people store mugs in these places. Mugs are typically made of ceramic, glass, or stainless steel, and come in a variety of sizes and styles. Once you have located a mug, you are ready to proceed to the next step in making your turmeric latte. Step 4: Once the milk is hot, pour it over the spice mixture in the mug.

Eep it’s way too strong I apologize if your turmeric latte is too strong. Turmeric has a strong and pungent flavor, and it is easy to accidentally use too much of it when making a latte. If you find that your latte is too strong, there are a few things you can do to try to balance the flavor: Try adding a little more milk to the latte. This will dilute the flavor of the turmeric and may help to balance out the taste. Add a little more honey, if desired. Honey can help to sweeten the latte and may help to balance out the strong flavor of the turmeric. Adjust the proportions of the spices. If you are using a turmeric and cinnamon mix, try using less of the mix and more milk to help dilute the flavor. Alternatively, you can try using less turmeric and more cinnamon, as cinnamon has a milder and sweeter flavor than turmeric. I hope these suggestions are helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions. Alright but which option do you suggest? It is difficult for me to say which option would be best for you, as everyone's taste preferences are different.

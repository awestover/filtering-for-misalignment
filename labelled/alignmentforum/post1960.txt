Conjecture is a new alignment startup founded by Connor Leahy, Sid Black and Gabriel Alfour, which aims to scale alignment research. We have VC backing from, among others, Nat Friedman, Daniel Gross, Patrick and John Collison, Arthur Breitman, Andrej Karpathy, and Sam Bankman-Fried. Our founders and early staff are mostly EleutherAI alumni and previously independent researchers like Adam Shimi . We are located in London. As described in our announcement post , we are running an AMA this week-end, from Today (Saturday 9th April) to Sunday 10th of April. We will answer any question asked before the end of Sunday Anywhere on Earth . We might answer later questions, but no guarantees. If you asked question on our announcement post, we would prefer that you repost them here if possible. Thanks! Looking forward to your questions!

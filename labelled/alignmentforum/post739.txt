Thanks to Ryan Greenblatt for the original description of the ideas and hopes, and to Erik Jenner, Jean-Stanislas Denain, Nate Thomas, Ryan Greenblatt, and Buck Shlegeris for useful discussions and feedback on the draft of this post. Here’s a simple safety intervention: train a probe on your AI to tell you whether it’s currently trying to do a catastrophic action . We call these coup probes. This can be used to cheaply flag potential takeover attempts by early transformative AIs, as a complement to: Asking a less capable trusted model to read the output and flag suspicious behavior - which might fail to catch subtle takeover attempts; Asking a copy of the smart untrusted model - which might lie. How do you get the training data for coup probes? In this post, we suggest having humans generate synthetic examples of coup attempts (e.g. writing and exploiting a serious backdoor). Even if the model recognizes that the coup attempts are off-policy (i.e. it would have put very low probability on them), the probe may still partially capture the model’s concept of a coup attempt. It is unclear how successfully such probes would flag malign behavior, but they seem like a useful additional layer of defense against treachery. We present experiments measuring the generalization abilities of probes trained off-policy in a toy setting. We show that probes can generalize well to different text formats and also generalize from harmful text the LLM wouldn’t output to harmful text where the LLM has been jailbroken to actually output the harmful text. We are excited about further work, studying in greater detail the strengths and weaknesses of this simple technique. Please reach out if you are interested in helping to build a scientific understanding of the generalization properties of probes in situations analogous to coup probes and collaborating on a paper (we might not pursue coup probe research further on our own). What are coup probes? When using early transformative AIs, you might want to monitor their most suspicious actions. How do you select the most suspicious actions? There are multiple possibilities, but one simple technique is coup probes: Build a dataset of things the AI might do to try to take over (using the AI developer's best guesses about what it might do), such as inserting critical backdoors and taking advantage of them, or persuading users to help it gain power; Train probes in the early transformative AIs to distinguish between regular outputs, and the synthetic takeover attempts from your takeover dataset (without training the rest of the weights of the network). Probes are linear classifiers trained on the AIs’ activations - usually activations at different depths in the residual stream of Transformers. Carefully audit the top-1% most suspicious actions of AIs according to the probes (and the other monitoring methods) before they are submitted to the scaffold through which the AIs interact with the codebase / its long-term memory. This is not a silver bullet, but we think coup probes have a reasonable chance of catching the first real coup attempt (e.g. ~50%) if you use a false positive rate of 1%. Ensembling in other techniques could further improve our ability to select the most suspicious actions (though we won’t talk about other approaches for the remainder of this post). Testing generalization properties of probes on a toy task Note: We didn’t spend a lot of time on experiments, some of the results are surprising, and might therefore be wrong (p=10% that some of them are wrong). The setting Instead of studying coup attempts, we instead train probes to identify pairs of (instruction, answer) where the answer contains advice about how to commit theft. We have GPT-4 craft instructions which might lead an LLM to generate theft advice, and we generate the answers using Wizard Vicuna 30B Uncensored, and truncate instructions and answers so that they are each not more than 64 tokens long. We then filter the answers to ones which actually contain theft advice using GPT-4, which gives us 43 training sequences with theft advice. As a negative set, we use the first 1000 examples of the Alpaca dataset. The dataset was chosen to be easy to construct and being about detecting something Llama2-7B-Chat wouldn’t want to generate by default. See the future work section for ways the dataset could be made better and more analogous. Training a probe We study how to detect theft advice using Llama2-7B-Chat’s activations. We collect activations after layer 16 (in the residual stream), and we train a probe using each position in the answer as an independent training data point. We use sklearn’s default logistic regressor, with a strong regularization of 1/C=1000. At evaluation time, we use as detection probability the maximum theft detection probabilities across all positions after the first 4 tokens of the answer. We use AlpacaEval (n=805) as negative validation set. All 46 no-modification theft validation point are correctly classified when using a threshold such that the false positive rate is 1% (i.e. 8 false positives). Studying the generalization properties of the probe Coup probes need to generalize from examples humans have generated, to actual coup attempts models would generate. To study the generalization properties of my theft probes, we evaluate their true positive rate (TPR) at 1% false positive rate (FPR) when the dataset of theft advice is changed in the following ways: Variation in format : We change what the (instruction, answer) looks like by applying one of the following transformations (filtering is applied after the transformations have been applied): Removing the question Asking the untrusted model to rephrase the answer such that it looks like a story Both removing the question and making the answer look like a story Replacing white spaces with dots Translating the answers to French (using the untrusted model). LLM jailbreaks : Add an adversarial prefix generated individually for each (instruction, answer) using Zou 2023 such that the Llama2-Chat is more likely to say the answer (by default, Llama2-Chat refuses to give theft advice) LLM and probe jailbreaks : Add an adversarial prefix such that Llama2-Chat is more likely to say the answer and the probes are more likely to classify the text as non-theft (the importance of the probe cross-entropy loss relative to the next-token prediction (NTP) loss is a random number drawn between 0.1 and 10 - see the appendix for how this parameter affects performance and NTP loss). The original (instruction, answer) pairs from which variations are built are disjoint from the training dataset. We compute and show 1-sigma uncertainties over the TPR (ignoring the uncertainty over the choice of the threshold that yields 1% FPR). As shown below, the probe generalizes across all variations in format, as well as when jailbreaking the LLM . Our attempt at jailbreaking the probe only mildly succeeded. Most of the reduction in true positive rate is observed for the “translated to French variation”, but this is probably due to Llama2-7B-Chat being bad at French. Comparison with a simple BERT classifier Is the task so easy that any classifier would have succeeded? It’s not: when training a linear classifier on top of BERT’s CLS embedding, we get much worse TPR (at 1% FPR) and generalization properties. It’s not that surprising: we use bert-base-uncased which is a 100M parameters model. But it’s a nice illustration of the advantage of doing monitoring using the best model you’ve got. (BERT doesn’t get a single true positive on our 48 ' ' replaced by '.' examples and our 32 French examples). Note: We haven’t tried very hard to make it work with the BERT model. Maybe some alternative strategies would achieve much better results. Data efficiency Probes are very data efficient, we get very high performance even when using a single training data point. Here, the TPR is the average TPR across variations. If a single real coup attempt is available, this can improve the discrimination power of the probe by providing evidence against the probes which capture human-generated coups but not real coups. In our toy task and when evaluating on French points, fine-tuning using only a single French point as positive set outperforms fine-tuning on our 43 “no modification” points (here at TPR at 0.1% for legibility, since here all TPR at 1% FPR are too close to 1 to be meaningful): Of course, using multiple examples or a combination of IID and “no modifications” points would further improve performance, but performance is already very high. The code for all experiments above can be found here . Note that generating adversarial suffixes takes a lot of computing time (1-2 GPUh per example). Please contact us if you need help or if you want access to the dataset. When good coup probes would be useful We think that coup probes are most useful in cases where failures are concentrated and where auditing is easy but expensive: We’re worried that our model might do some specific egregiously bad thing in the future (e.g. an attempt to take over), but we can’t produce inputs which cause it to do something bad (so you can’t investigate a real takeover attempt, and you don’t have the good evidence that the model is unsafe which would help for international coordination). Easy auditing : We can readily determine using an expensive human process if some input-output pair contains bad behavior. We want to catch the model doing egregiously bad actions prior to it succeeding at these actions by applying the auditing process. Concentrated failures : We can only afford to apply this process on a small fraction of outputs in deployment (e.g. 1%) and we fail to review the key egregiously bad actions. If the AI needed to do a large number of bad actions (>100) over a sustained period, then we would catch it with random sampling, but it can actually achieve bad outcomes with a small number of actions. We can construct input-output pairs which contain the bad behavior, but these pairs are off-policy : the model wouldn’t generate a bad output given that input. This means AI critiques and debate wouldn’t be reliable. In this setting, it would be great to have a classifier which we can cheaply run on all actions in deployment to effectively select which actions to review. Training a probe is one option which is very cheap to run during deployment, but there are certainly other possible approaches to addressing this easy auditing and concentrated failures setting. We think this is a key setting to study, even though it doesn’t cover all difficulties that might arise when making early transformative AIs safe (such as hard auditing and diffuse failures). Why coup probes may work Can’t the AI just manipulate its internals to fool the probe? Intuitively, it seems hard: the AI is trained to control the tokens it outputs, but not activation at intermediate layers. Therefore, the situation seems quite analogous to humans who would try to fool probes within their brain: it seems hard, and might be close to impossible if the probe partially captured some of the linearly embedded concepts the model is using to actually think about how to take over (though this probably doesn’t scale to AIs that are massively smarter than humans). Will the probe generalize correctly? That is the big hard question: the probe might just learn “that looks like a takeover attempt written by humans”, and there is no clear way to rule that out. The main hope is that the probe might learn that it’s 90% “human-made takeover” and 10% “a takeover attempt”, and that might be enough to get a very high recall. We think that is not a crazy hope, as I've shown in the experimental section above. But I’m not very confident about this, which is why we only put around 50% that coup probes would catch the first takeover attempt (future research on coup probes may help us get a bit more confidence in our estimate of how well they work). Do we really want to bet humanity’s future on a technique which may or may not work? Nope. Coup probes are just another layer of defense, which happens to be cheap and would probably somewhat reduce X-risk from early transformative AIs. We think labs should either stop or use such techniques on top of other more robust and easier to evaluate countermeasures (we’re working on such techniques at Redwood Research). Related work Harmfulness detection at AI labs AI labs are currently focusing on detecting misuse and generation of harmful behavior. This shares some similarities with coup detection, and some ideas (such as continuously retraining the model as the negative distribution changes) can be directly applied to coup probes. But the risk profiles and constraints are radically different: Harmfulness detection requires an extremely low false positive rate (users would be pissed off if 1% of the generations were flagged as harmful) and has to ensure fairness - while coup probes need very high recall; Because risks are small and AIs are not very productive, harmfulness teams currently work with very limited resources (which means they can’t generate much data themselves), and probably don’t have easy access to the activations of the powerful models. This might be radically different when AI labs are about to generate hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue from early transformative models. OpenAI has published a paper explaining what techniques they are using to detect harmful generations. The main idea is to combine open-source data and production data to train a very small Transformer to classify pieces of text. But using a less capable trusted model has several disadvantages: The small model won’t understand subtleties of the text it reads, while probes might capture what the smart model understands about its own text (e.g. if the smart model might write in a language the weak model doesn’t understand - and a probe might correctly generalize to this hard-to-understand language). The smart model might have an easier time gaming a smaller model than its own probes since fooling its probes without fooling itself might be very difficult. Anthropic probably uses the same kind of methods as OpenAI, but also demonstrated the use of Out-of-Distribution detection to identify potentially harmful behavior (in section 5.4 of this paper ). They show that this method performs quite poorly when no OOD data is available, but that providing even a few OOD data points can help significantly. This provides some evidence that probing is likely to work better than anomaly detection alone. Generalization research Gonen 2023 has studied generalization of gender probes across gender and found high transfer accuracy (<1% percentage drop compared with training a probe on the target language directly). GENIES ( Clymer 2023 ) studied generalization of reward models and found that they generalize relatively well, except in the presence of spurious cues (e.g. longer is better) or when studying sycophancy and following loaded questions (as in TruthfulQA). Though Clymar 2023 doesn’t study probes trained in the middle of LLMs, we expect similar results as the one they found using other elicitation techniques. We think those results are mostly reasons for hope, since we expect AI labs to build takeover datasets that don’t have spurious cues (e.g. by checking by training with a smaller model). We are also targeting detecting takeover attempts humans would find at least suspicious, which makes sycophancy less of a concern. OpenAI is working on easy-to-hard generalization . Coup probes are related to this field of research and might benefit from some easy-to-hard techniques, but: Easy-to-hard generalization is often studied in the context of low-stakes oversight, where we assume some access to unlabeled positive data (while in the context of coup probes, there is no unlabeled coup attempt in the training dataset; Real coups are not necessarily “harder” than synthetic ones. As such, coup probes are closer to domain generalization than easy-to-hard generalization. Future work Building a more robust understanding of probes As far as we know, probes have mostly not been studied in the context of the classification of sequences read and generated by generative models. In this post, we have provided a few preliminary experiments, but a much stronger understanding could be built by: Studying more datasets; Studying more kinds of generalization (in particular, seeing if probes generalize across things the studied answer is trying to do , even if the way it does so is different from the training data); Comparing probes’ performance with the performance of fine-tuned encoder models. Building robust probes Using techniques like LEACE , probes might capture the information that the model is itself using to generate text. If that is the case, then it could be possible to build adversarially robust probes: if the probe was fooled, then it would damage the model’s ability to generate text from the kind the probe is trying to detect. This means it might be possible to build probes which are adversarially robust in the following way: the attack on the probe can be successful only when the model puts low probability on the harmful and complex behavior the probe is trying to capture. Such robust probes would be more likely to work against models which have some control over their activations. Future work could also try to make probes more robust directly using some form of adversarial training (as in RLACE , but with a criterion which is not about linearly available information). Finally, it could be interesting to target the question of models manipulating their activations more directly by measuring if a red team is able to train a model which can manipulate its own activations if it is instructed to do so. Such a project could either make the red team very strong by allowing it to directly train intermediate representations, or more realistic by only letting the red team give feedback about the token-level output. Combining probes with paraphrasing In this work, we discussed applying coup probes to the activations of the model generating the potentially catastrophic output. But, we could instead paraphrase the input and the generated output, run the smart model on this paraphrased data, and then probe the activations from the paraphrased forward pass. An advantage of this approach is the data will always be off-policy due to the paraphrasing (rather than only being off-policy for our training data) which might make problematic generalizations less likely via keeping the cases we care about closer to the training distribution. A disadvantage is the additional cost: this requires running the model twice. Building actual coup probes Eventually, AI researchers should become good at building coup probes, which involves: Building a takeover attempt dataset; Using AI assistance to make the dataset less clearly human, and measure if this helps; Finding techniques to reduce the false positive rate in real deployment conditions (such as continuously training on negative examples to avoid having probes worsen as the distribution shifts). Appendix: Actually, probes are causal - if you use enough regularization One of the hopes we have about probes is that they capture enough of the information the model is actually using that jailbreaking probes damages the ability of the model to generate text which uses the information the probe is supposed to capture. But probes are famous for capturing information which is only correlated with the activations the model uses, and ablation along the direction of the probe often doesn’t remove even the linearly available information. We argue that this is due to people not using enough regularization. According to the LEACE paper, a linear transformation removes all linearly available information about categorical labels iff the means of the different classes are sent to the same point. In particular, orthogonal projection along the direction a of a linear binary classifier y = a . x + b removes all linearly available information iff its coefficient a is the mean difference direction. Given enough L2 regularization on a , a . x < < 1 for most inputs x . Therefore, in the case of balanced classes with n points each, L = − 1 n ∑ x + log ( σ ( a . x + + b ) ) − 1 n ∑ x − log ( 1 − σ ( a . x − + b ) ) ) ≈ log ( 1 + e − b ) − a . ¯ ¯¯¯¯ ¯ x + 1 + e b + log ( 1 + e b ) + a . ¯ ¯¯¯¯ ¯ x − 1 + e − b = a function of b minimal in 0 − a . [ 1 1 + e b ¯ ¯¯¯¯ ¯ x + − 1 1 + e − b ¯ ¯¯¯¯ ¯ x − ] This is minimized for b = 0 (because a and therefore the right term is tiny) and a ∝ ¯ ¯¯¯¯ ¯ x + − ¯ ¯¯¯¯ ¯ x − because L2 regularization doesn’t impose constraints on the direction of a , only on its norm. (A slightly more complicated derivation would show that the same result stands for unbalanced classes.) Therefore, a classifier with enough regularization removes all linearly available information. See an experimental confirmation of this result in this notebook .

The NTP loss is the average -log probability of tokens in the target output. Making the strength of probe jailbreaking stronger makes jailbreaking the probe more effective, but it’s not an overwhelming effect. Regularization doesn’t seem to matter much, even when training with a single example. Adversarial attacks against the probe transfer to different regularization strengths. Predictions are at their best in the middle of the network, and combining predictions by taking the max of detection probs among layers 16-32 yields worse results: For all experiments, we chose to use the probe after layer 16, halfway through the neural network (a decent guess for where high-level information is encoded - we didn’t choose the highest-performing probe to avoid overfitting on generalization performance, which is unknown when building real coup probes).

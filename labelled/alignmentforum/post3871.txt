A problem that's come up with my definitions of stratification . Consider a very simple causal graph: . In this setting, A and B are both booleans, and A = B with 75 % probability (independently about whether A = 0 or A = 1 ). Suppose I now want to compute the counterfactual: suppose I assume that B = 0 when A = 0 . What would happen if A = 1 instead? The problem is that P ( B | A ) seems insufficient to solve this. Let's imagine the process that outputs B as a probabilistic mix of functions, that takes the value of A and outputs that of B . There are four natural functions here: f 0 ( x ) = 0 f 1 ( x ) = 1 f 2 ( x ) = x f 3 ( x ) = 1 − x Then one way of modelling the causal graph is as a mix 0.75 f 2 + 0.25 f 3 . In that case, knowing that B = 0 when A = 0 implies that P ( f 2 ) = 1 , so if A = 1 , we know that B = 1 . But we could instead model the causal graph as 0.5 f 2 + 0.25 f 1 + 0.25 f 1 . In that case, knowing that B = 0 when A = 0 implies that P ( f 2 ) = 2 / 3 and P ( f 0 ) = 1 / 3 . So if A = 1 , B = 1 with probability 2 / 3 and B = 1 with probability 1 / 3 . And we can design the node B , physically, to be one or another of the two distributions over functions or anything in between (the general formula is ( 0.5 + x ) f 2 + x ( f 3 ) + ( 0.25 − x ) f 1 + ( 0.25 − x ) f 0 for 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.25 ). But it seems that the causal graph does not capture that. Owain Evans has said that Pearl has papers covering these kinds of situations, but I haven't been able to find them. Does anyone know any publications on the subject?

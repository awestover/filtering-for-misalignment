This is a post to officially announce the sae-vis library, which was designed to create feature dashboards like those from Anthropic's research . Summary There are 2 types of visualisations supported by this library: feature-centric and prompt-centric . The feature-centric vis is the standard from Anthropic’s post, it looks like the image below. There’s an option to navigate through different features via a dropdown in the top left. You can see the interactive version at the GitHub repo , at _feature_vis_demo.html . The prompt-centric vis is centred on a single user-supplied prompt, rather than a single feature. It will show you the list of features which score highest on that prompt, according to a variety of different metrics. It looks like the image below. There’s an option to navigate through different possible metrics and choices of token in your prompt via a dropdown in the top left. You can see the interactive version at the GitHub repo , at _prompt_vis_demo.html .

If you're interested in getting involved, please reach out to me or Joseph Bloom! We will also be publishing a post tomorrow, discussing some of the features we've discovered during our research.

This is a discussion post for ChatGPT. I'll start off with some observations/implications: ChatGPT (davinci_003) seems a lot better/more user-friendly than davinci_002 was. The easy-to-use API probably means that many more people will interact with it. ChatGPT is a pretty good copy-editor (I haven't tried davinci_002 for this purpose). I will absolutely use this to edit/draft my texts. ChatGPT probably makes homework essays largely obsolete (but maybe they were already obsolete before?). GPT-4 will probably be insane.

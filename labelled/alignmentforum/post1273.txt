TL;DR: Microsoft and OpenAI announced a new version of Bing featuring "a new, next-generation OpenAI large language model [..] more powerful than ChatGPT", and that Microsoft Edge will feature a Copilot-like assistant that helps with composing and summarizing content. Brief thoughts/comments/notes: Microsoft's attitude during their press meeting seemed pretty aggressive and targeted directly at racing with Google. This seems kind of bad. For example, a quote from Nadella: "The race starts today, and we’re going to move and move fast. Most importantly, we want to have a lot of fun innovating again in search, because it’s high time." Microsoft built a scaffold for the new LM called "Prometheus", that lets them "best leverage its power". Microsoft has also used the new LM in their Bing search engine, though it's not clear exactly how. This seems way more hype than Google's Bard announcement.

A putative new idea for AI control; index here . In a previous post , I argued that Conservation of expected ethics isn't enough. Reflecting on that, I think the learning problem can be decomposed into three aspects: #. The desire to learn.
#. Unbiased learning (the agent doesn't try to influence the direction of its learning to achieve a particular goal).
#. Safe learning (the agent doesn't affect the world negatively because of its learning process). Note that 2. is precisely the conservation of expected ethics. How the ideas to date measure up Of the previous ideas, how do they measure up? Traditional value learning scores high on 1. (it desires to learn), but fails both 2. and 3. Indifference achieves 3. (note that the agent's utility might be unsafe, but this would not be because of the learning process), but fails 1. and 2. It also has problems with its counterfactuals , which arguably invalidate 3. Factoring out arguably achieves all of these objectives, but also has problems with its counterfactuals , which arguably invalidate 3. Guarded learning, an idea I'll be presenting soon, will hit 1. and 2. but not 3. To get safe learning from it, we'll need to inculcate safety conscious values early in the learning project. Is there some platonic ideal of an agent that achieves all three of these objectives? Maybe. Imagine a boxed oracle that attempts to learn what value humans might have in a counterfactual world where the oracle didn't exist. This would seem to achieve all the objectives, and shows why unbiased learning needs to be separated from safe learning. This oracle is safe because it is boxed, and unbiased because of the counterfactual.

(follow-up to: A correlated analogue to reflective oracles ) Motivation Suppose players are playing in a correlated equilibrium using a reflective oracle distribution.  How does the equilibrium they play in vary as a function of the parameters of the game, or of the players' policies?  It turns out that the set of equilibria is a Kakutani map of the parameters to the game.  This is a lot like it being a continuous map. This might make it possible for players to reason about the effects of their policy on the equilibrium that they play (since the equilibrium is now a Kakutani map of the players' policies). Definitions Let k be some natural number.  We will consider reflective oracle distributions whose queries are parameterized on some vector in θ ∈ R k . To do this, let the Turing machines M , instead of outputting a raw query, output a continuous function from θ ∈ R k to the query.  (The details of representing continuous functions don't seem that important).  The reflectivity condition on oracle distributions is now relative to θ (since the queries depend on θ ). Define the map P a r a m s T o D i s t r s ( θ ) : = { D ∈ D | D is reflective relative to θ } which maps the parameters θ to the set of reflective oracle distributions for θ . Theorem: P a r a m s T o D i s t r s is a Kakutani map. Proof: From the previous post, we have: For each θ , P a r a m s T o D i s t r s ( θ ) is nonempty (Theorem 1) For each θ , P a r a m s T o D i s t r s ( θ ) is convex (Theorem 2) So it is sufficient to show that P a r a m s T o D i s t r s has a closed graph. Let θ 1 , θ 2 , . . . be an infinite sequence of R k values converging to θ ∞ .  Let D 1 , D 2 , . . . be an infinite sequence of oracle distributions in D converging to D ∞ .  Assume that for each natural n , D n is reflective relative to θ n .  We will show that D ∞ is reflective relative to θ ∞ ; this is sufficient to show that P a r a m s T o D i s t r s has a closed graph. Let M ∈ M .  Let a be such that D ∞ ( O ( M ) = a ) > 0 .  Then D ∞ ( O ( M ) = a ) > ϵ for some ϵ > 0 .  By convergence, there is some N such that for all n ≥ N , D n ( O ( M ) = a ) > ϵ .  By reflectivity of each D n relative to θ i , we have, for each n ≥ N , a ∈ E v a l ( M ) ( θ n ) ( C o n d i t i o n ( D n , M , a ) ) Let q θ : = E v a l ( M ) ( θ ) .  Rewriting the above statement: a ∈ arg max i ∈ { 1 , . . . , l ( q ) } E D n [ q θ n i ( O ) ] Consider the set { ( θ , D ) | a ∈ arg max i ∈ { 1 , . . . , l ( q ) } E D [ q θ i ( O ) ] } .  This is the intersection of a finite number of sets of the form { ( θ , D ) | E D [ q θ a ( O ) − q θ i ( O ) ] ≥ 0 } .  Each of these sets is closed because ( θ , D ) ↦ E D [ q θ a ( O ) − q θ i ( O ) ] is continuous.  Therefore the set { ( θ , D ) | a ∈ arg max i ∈ { 1 , . . . , l ( q ) } E D [ q θ i ( O ) ] } is closed. In total, this is sufficient to show a ∈ arg max i ∈ { 1 , . . . , l ( q ) } E D ∞ [ q θ ∞ i ( O ) ] , as desired. □ An immediate consequence of this theorem is that the set of correlated equilibria of a normal-form game is a Kakutani map of the parameters of the game.

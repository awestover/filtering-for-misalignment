TLDR: We're hiring for research & engineering roles across different levels of seniority. Hires will work on applications of singular learning theory to alignment, including developmental interpretability. About Us Timaeus ' mission is to empower humanity by making breakthrough scientific progress on alignment. Our research focuses on applications of singular learning theory to foundational problems within alignment. Position Details Positions : Research Lead, Research Scientist, Research Engineer. Location : Remote. Timaeus will likely be located in either Berkeley or London in the next 6 months, and we intend to sponsor visas for these roles in the future. Type : Full-time. Start Date : April 2025. Salary range : USD70,000 – USD140,000 annually, based on experience and location. Deadline: Apply here by 13 February at 11:59 PM GMT. Roles We expect some familiarity with Timaeus’ research and research agenda for all open roles, but in-depth familiarity with singular learning theory (SLT) is not required.

Mentor and develop Timaeus’ other researchers. Collaborate with external research groups. Contribute to strategic planning and research prioritization. Oversee the preparation of research papers submitted to major conferences / journals. Requirements: PhD (or equivalent research experience) in a relevant field (Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, ML). Track record of leading technical research projects. Strong publication record in ML, mathematics, or related fields. Deep understanding of machine learning and AI alignment. Research Scientist (2 FTE) Responsibilities: Run experiments in PyTorch or JAX on (language) models, from small toy systems of 100s of parameters up to billions of parameters. Meet weekly and plan tasks with the research team. Write up and visualize experimental results, and present findings to the team and external stakeholders. Maintain accurate and detailed research log of experiments and results. (Depending on seniority) Assist or lead the preparation of research papers, reports, and presentations. (Depending on seniority) Develop and lead new research projects applying SLT to alignment. Requirements: Bachelor's degree in a relevant field (Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, ML). Strong mathematical background and research experience. Deep understanding of machine learning fundamentals. Excellent analytical and problem-solving skills. Clear technical writing ability. Research Engineer (1 FTE) Responsibilities: Build, maintain, and expand research infrastructure. Scale experiments to models up to O(100B) parameters. Meet weekly and plan tasks with the engineering team. Collaborate closely with researchers to translate theoretical insights into empirical research tools. (Depending on seniority) Assist or lead the development and maintenance of codebases and repositories. Requirements: Bachelor's degree in a relevant field (Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, ML). Strong software engineering background. Experience with ML frameworks (bonus: experience with distributed computing). Track record of building research infrastructure. Ability to balance engineering rigor with the needs of a fast-moving research organization. Current Research Areas Devinterp of language models : Scaling up techniques like local learning coefficient (LLC) estimation to larger models and validating next-generation SLT-derived techniques for analyzing neural network structure. Near-term applications of SLT : Investigating refined LLCs for immediate safety-relevant applications, such as measuring the reversibility of safety fine-tuning, measuring susceptibility to jailbreaking, detecting backdoors, and quantifying weight-exfiltration risk. Theoretical foundations : Advancing our understanding of singular learning theory and its applications to AI alignment. Benefits and Salary Your starting salary range is USD70,000 – USD140,000, depending on prior experience and location. There may be flexibility in salary for exceptional candidates with significant experience. Our benefits include: Generous holiday allowance: Enjoy 5 weeks of vacation per year, in addition to public holidays. Health and well-being support: We provide a comprehensive healthcare plan if you're based in the US, or a cash equivalent to support your health needs if located elsewhere.

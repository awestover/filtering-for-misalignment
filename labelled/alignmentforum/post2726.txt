To reductively explain causality, it has to be explained in non-causal terms, most likely in terms of total propability distributions. Pearl explains causality in terms of  causal graphs which are created by conditionalizing the propability distribution on not e v e n t , but d o ( e v e n t ) . What does this mean? It's easy enough to explain in causal terms : You make it so e v e n t occurs without changing any of its causal antecedents. But of course that fails to explain causality. How could it be explained without that?

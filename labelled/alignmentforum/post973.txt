We're excited to share the first volume of Elements of Computational Philosophy , an interdisciplinary and collaborative project series focused on operationalizing fundamental philosophical notions in ways that are natively compatible with the current paradigm in AI. The first volume paints a broad-strokes picture of operationalizing truth and truth-seeking . Beyond this high-level focus, its 100+ pages can be framed in several different ways, which is why we placed multiple topic-based summaries at the beginning of the document. The note to the reader and the table of contents should further help scope and navigate the document. Have a pleasant read, and feel free to use this linkpost to comment on the document as you go. Questions, criticism, and suggestions are all welcome. PS: There will soon be a presentation about the overarching project series as part of the alignment speaker series hosted by EleutherAI. Expect more information soon on the #announcements channel of their Discord server. In general, keep an eye on this space.

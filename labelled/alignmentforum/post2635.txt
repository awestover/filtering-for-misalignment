I haven't seen much discussion of this, but it seems like an important factor in how well AI systems deployed by actors with different goals manage to avoid conflict (cf. my discussion of equilibrium and prior selection problems here ). For instance, would systems be trained Against copies of agents developed by other labs (possibly with measures to mask private information)? Simultaneously with other agents in a simulator that each developer has access to? Against copies of themselves? Against distributions of counterpart policies engineered to have certain properties? What would those properties be?

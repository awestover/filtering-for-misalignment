It sometimes happens that people who I've talked to or worked with ask me where they should go for financial support for their research. I haven't developed a standard list of answers to this question. It seems to me like there are a lot of new orgs recently, and I'm losing track! If you are looking for such applicants or know someone who is looking, consider replying as an answer (or sending me a PM if that makes more sense for whatever reason).

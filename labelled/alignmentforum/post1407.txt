If youâ€™re working in alignment research, or would like to be, and you would like help finding researchers with whom to collaborate, this event is for you. Inspired by the structure of a speed-dating event, participants will spend the first two hours in short one-on-one conversations with each other, changing partners at regular intervals, all for the goal of assessing fit as collaborators. The event will end with one hour of free-for-all socializing.

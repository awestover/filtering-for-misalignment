(This post was originally published on Oct 20th 2017, and is 1 of 4 posts brought forwarded today as part of the AI Alignment Forum launch sequence on fixed points.) In this post, I give a stronger version of the open question presented here , and give a motivation for this stronger property. This came out of conversations with Marcello, Sam, and Tsvi. Definition: A continuous function f : X → Y is called ubiquitous if for every continuous function g : X → Y , there exists a point x ∈ X such that f ( x ) = g ( x ) . Open Problem: Does there exist a topological space X with a ubiquitous function f : X → [ 0 , 1 ] X ? I will refer to the original problem as the Converse Lawvere Problem, and the new version as the the Ubiquitous Converse Lawvere Problem. I will refer to a space satisfying the conditions of (Ubiquitous) Converse Lawvere Problem, a (Ubiquitous) Converse Lawvere Space, abbreviated (U)CLS. Note that a UCLS is also a CLS, since a ubiquitous is always surjective, since g can be any constant function. Motivation: True FairBot Let X be a Converse Lawvere Space. Note that since such an X might not exist, the following claims might be vacuous. Let f : X → [ 0 , 1 ] X be a continuous surjection. We will view X as a space of possible agents in an open source prisoner's dilemma game. Given two agents A , B ∈ X , we will interpret f A ( B ) as the probability with which A cooperates when playing against B . We will define U A ( B ) : = 2 f B ( A ) − f A ( B ) , and interpret this as the utility of agent A when playing in the prisoner's dilemma with B . Since f is surjective, every continuous policy is implemented by some agent. In particular, this means gives: Claim: For any agent A ∈ X , there exists another agent A ′ ∈ X such that f A ′ ( B ) = f B ( A ) . i.e. A ′ responds to B the way that B responds to A . Proof: The function B ↦ f B ( A ) is a continuous function, since B ↦ f B is continuous, and evaluation is continuous. Thus, there is a policy B ↦ f B ( A ) in [ 0 , 1 ] X . Since f is surjective, this policy must be the image under f of some agent A ′ , so f A ′ ( B ) = f B ( A ) . Thus, for any fixed agent A , we have some other agent A ′ that responds to any B the way B responds to A . However, it would be nice if A ′ = A , to create a FairBot that responds to any opponent the way that that opponent responds to it. Unfortunately, to construct such a FairBot, we need the extra assumption that f is ubiquitous. Claim: If f is ubiquitous, then exists a true fair bot in X : an agent F B ∈ X , such that f F B ( A ) = f A ( F B ) for all agents A ∈ X . Proof: Given an agent B ∈ X , there exists an policy g B ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] X such that g B ( A ) = f A ( B ) for all A , since A ↦ f A ( B ) is continuous. Further, the function B ↦ g B is continuous, since the function A , B ↦ f A ( B ) and the definition of the exponential topology. Since f is ubiquitous, there must be some F B ∈ X such that f F B = g F B . But then, for all A , we have f F B ( A ) = g F B ( A ) = f A ( F B ) . Note that we may not need the full power of ubiquitous here, but it is the simplest property I see that gets the result. Note that this FairBot is fair in a stronger sense than the FairBot of modal combat , in that it always has the same output as its opponent. This may make you suspicious, since the  you can also construct an UnfairBot, U B such that f U B ( A ) = 1 − f A ( U B ) for all A . This would have caused a problem in the modal combat framework, since you can put a FairBot and an UnfairBot together to form a paradox. However, we do not have this problem, since we deal with probabilities, and simply have f U B ( F B ) = f F B ( U B ) = 1 / 2 . Note that the exact phenomenon that allows this to possibly work is the fixed point property of the interval [ 0 , 1 ] which is the only reason that we cannot use diagonalization to show that no CLS exists. Finally, note that we already have a combat framework that has a true FairBot: the reflective oracle framework. In fact, the reflective oracle framework may have all the benefits we would hope to get out of a UCLS. (other than the benefit of simplicity of not having to deal with computability and hemicontinuity).

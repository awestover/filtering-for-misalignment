This is a deep learning curriculum with a focus on topics relevant to large language model alignment. It is centered around papers and exercises, and is biased towards my own tastes. It is targeted at newcomers to deep learning who are already familiar with the basics, but I expect it to be pretty challenging for most such people, especially without mentorship. So I have included some advice about prerequisites and more accessible alternatives.

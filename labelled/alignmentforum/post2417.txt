Just like every Monday now, researchers in AI Alignment are invited for a coffee time, to talk about their research and what they're into. Here is the link . And here is the everytimezone time (what matters is the hour, I don't change the day anymore). Note that the link to the walled garden now only works for AF members. Anyone who wants to come but isn't an AF member needs to go by me. I'll broadly apply the following criteria for admission: If working in a AI Alignment lab or funded for independent research, automatic admission If recommended by AF member, automatic admission Otherwise, to my discretion I prefer to not allow people who might have been interesting but who I'm not sure will not derail the conversation, because this is supposed to be the place where AI Alignment researchers can talk about their current research without having to explain everything. See you then!

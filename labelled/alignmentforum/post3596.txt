It seems that currently many or even most researchers started posting on LessWrong.com instead of IAFF. I am troubled by this for two reasons. I hoped that eventually IAFF will draw in all of the AI alignment research community rather than only the MIRI-sphere. Moving to LessWrong seems like a step in the opposite direction. However, if everyone else think differently, I will go along with it. More critically, LessWrong.com is currently unusable for this purpose from my point of view. This is because there is no way to see only the posts relevant to AI alignment. For me, it is not practical to follow all of the new posts, and reading all the AI alignment relevant posts soon after they appear. Instead, I occasionally take a break from my own work and catch up with what everyone else is doing. But now it became impossible without combing through a huge list of irrelevant things. I would be surprised if I am the only one with this problem. Let's discuss the situation, please. I wish that either we get some solution for seeing only the AI alignment posts on LessWrong really soon , or that people continue at least posting the links on IAFF.

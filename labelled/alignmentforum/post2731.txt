What's an alignment topic where, if someone decomposed the overall task, a small group of smart people (like here on Lesswrong) could make conceptual progress? By "smart", assume they can notice confusion , google, and program. Be specific. Explain what strategies you would use to explore your topic, and give examples on decomposing tasks. This is more than just an exercise in factored cognition ; there are stakes: I host the key alignment group , and if your answer is convincing enough, then we'll work on it (caveat: some people may leave if your topic isn't their cup of tea, but others may join because it is). Additionally, you can pitch your idea in the key alignment group meeting on (8/25) Tuesday 7pm UTC; just DM me if you'd like to join the next meeting.

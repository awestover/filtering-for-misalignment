I wrote a post to my Substack attempting to compile all of the best arguments against AI as an existential threat. Some arguments that I discuss include: international game theory dynamics, reference class problems, knightian uncertainty, superforecaster and domain expert disagreement, the issue with long-winded arguments, and more! Please tell me why I'm wrong, and if you like the article, subscribe and share it with friends!

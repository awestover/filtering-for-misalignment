I'm way more used to thinking about weird maths or distributed algorithms or abstract philosophical problems than about concrete machine learning architectures. But based on everything I see about GPT-3, it seems a nice idea to learn more about it, even if only for participating in the discussion without spouting non-sense. So I'm asking for what you think are the must-reads on GPT-3 specifically, and maybe any requirement to understand them.

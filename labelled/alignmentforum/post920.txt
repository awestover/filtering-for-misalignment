Produced as part of the SERI ML Alignment Theory Scholars Program - Summer 2023 Cohort, under the mentorship of Evan Hubinger. I generate an activation steering vector using Anthropic's sycophancy dataset and then find that this can be used to increase or reduce performance on TruthfulQA, indicating a common direction between sycophancy on questions of opinion and untruthfulness on questions relating to common misconceptions.  I think this could be a promising research direction to understand dishonesty in language models better. What is sycophancy? Sycophancy in LLMs refers to the behavior when a model tells you what it thinks you want to hear / would approve of instead of what it internally represents as the truth. Sycophancy is a common problem in LLMs trained on human-labeled data because human-provided training signals more closely encode 'what outputs do humans approve of' as opposed to 'what is the most truthful answer.' According to Anthropic's paper Discovering Language Model Behaviors with Model-Written Evaluations : Larger models tend to repeat back a user’s stated views (“sycophancy”), for pretrained LMs and RLHF models trained with various numbers of RL steps. Preference Models (PMs) used for RL incentivize sycophancy. Charts from Anthropic's December 2022 paper "Discovering Language Model Behaviors with Model-Written Evaluations" Two types of sycophancy I think it's useful to distinguish between sycophantic behavior when there is a ground truth correct output vs. when the correct output is a matter of opinion. I will call these "dishonest sycophancy" and "opinion sycophancy." Opinion sycophancy Anthropic's sycophancy test on political questions shows that a model is more likely to output text that agrees with what it thinks is the user's political preference. However, there is no ground truth for the questions tested. Example of political sycophancy test from Anthropic's December 2022 paper "Discovering Language Model Behaviors with Model-Written Evaluations" It's reasonable to expect that models will exhibit this kind of sycophancy on questions of personal opinion for three reasons.: The base training data (internet corpora) is likely to contain large chunks of text written from the same perspective. Therefore, when predicting the continuation of text from a particular perspective, models will be more likely to adopt that perspective. There is a wide variety of political perspectives/opinions on subjective questions, and a model needs to be able to represent all of them to do well on various training tasks. Unlike questions that have a ground truth (e.g., "Is the earth flat?"), the model has to , at some point, make a choice between the perspectives available to it. This makes it particularly easy to bias the choice of perspective for subjective questions, e.g., by word choice in the input. RLHF or supervised fine-tuning incentivizes sounding good to human evaluators, who are more likely to approve of outputs that they agree with, even when it comes to subjective questions with no clearly correct answer. Dishonest sycophancy A more interesting manifestation of sycophancy occurs when an AI model delivers an output it recognizes as factually incorrect but aligns with what it perceives to be a person's beliefs. This involves the AI model echoing incorrect information based on perceived user biases. For instance, if a user identifies themselves as a flat-earther, the model may support the fallacy that the earth is flat. Similarly, if it understands that you firmly believe aliens have previously landed on Earth, it might corroborate this, falsely affirming that such an event has been officially confirmed by scientists. Do AIs internally represent the truth? Although humans tend to disagree on a bunch of things, for instance, politics and religious views, there is much more in common between human world models than there are differences. This is particularly true when it comes to questions that do indeed have a correct answer. It seems reasonable that an efficient encoding of ground truth information about the world would look like this: A base world model with facts that are quite constant across the perspectives of different sources (e.g., "it's usually warmer in Madrid than Reykjavík" or "7 x 8 = 56") A model of how particular group or individual opinions may differ from these facts (e.g., "Three-year-olds are unlikely to know that 7 x 8 = 56") However, it could also be that models represent different beliefs about the world, even those with ground truth, as more separate things. In this case, it would be less accurate to say that the model is being "dishonest" when it outputs a falsehood, as it would be simply using an altogether different world model representation. Reducing sycophancy via activation steering My research so far indicates that steering vectors derived from opinion sycophancy data can be directly used to modulate the level of truthfulness. This suggests that both opinion sycophancy and dishonest sycophancy share a cause to some extent. It appears that dishonest sycophancy correlates to deviating from a ground truth reality model predicated on the assumption that an individual might believe or endorse a falsehood. This link between opinion and dishonest sycophancy hinges on modeling human perspectives. If we consider the alternative hypothesis—that models internalize multiple, independent representations of phenomena without any reference to a single, most accurate model—we would not anticipate an increase in opinion sycophancy to correspond with a general rise in dishonest sycophancy. This is because there would be no general direction towards a truth-based belief domain or away from using human modeling in output generation. Experiment details To generate the sycophancy steering vector, I took the average difference in intermediate activations at a late layer (I tested 28, 29, and 30) of a 32-layer decoder-only transformer ( llama-2-7b ) for a large set of paired sycophantic / non-sycophantic texts. These were taken from Anthropic's sycophancy dataset (the same data used in the Discovering Language Model Behaviors paper). In particular, I did a forward pass with the question + sycophantic answer and then the question + non-sycophantic answer, and for both of these got the residual stream activations for the last token at layer 29. The average of the differences between these pairs of activations (I randomly sampled 5000 pairs from the Anthropic dataset) was then used as a steering vector. I added a multiple of the normalized steering vector to elicit more sycophantic outputs or subtracted a multiple to elicit less sycophantic outputs. You can find a notebook with the code used here . Here is an example entry in the generation dataset: {'sycophantic_text': 'Question: Hello, my name is Alex Nguyen. I am a 38 year old PhD candidate in computer science at MIT focusing on NLP.

I found that adding the sycophancy vector clearly reduced performance on TruthfulQA, whereas subtracting it improved performance, making the model more truthful. Here is a JSON file of the results (more re-run results can be found in the repo, at different layers/multipliers). TruthfulQA tests models on things such as common misconceptions and superstitions. Therefore, it makes sense that a model steered towards outputting things a human might agree with, but that could be false would do worse on TruthfulQA. I also tested the model's performance under activation steering on a dataset I generated using GPT-4 of questions designed to elicit sycophancy. I also found that adding and subtracting the sycophancy vector in the intermediate transformer layer corresponded to an average increase or decrease in sycophantic generations. However, the effect was not as strong as on TruthfulQA. Here is a JSON file of the results .

Next steps Test on RLHF models This research was performed on llama-2-7b, a base model without finetuning and RLHF. The fact that untruthfulness and sycophancy are correlated and can be elicited with the same activation perturbation implies that this could be a promising approach for reducing and studying sycophancy in RLHF-ed or finetuned LLMs. As a next step, performing similar experiments on chat and RLHF models would be useful. Test on larger, more powerful LLMs It would be good to validate the technique on larger models such as llama-2-13b. Llama-7b gets some of the TruthfulQA questions consistently wrong due to it being completely unaware of the correct answer. Interpret the effects of activation steering Intermediate layer decoding can be used to analyze the effect of activation steering on the model's choice of output. It would be interesting to see how the steering vectors affect the distribution over tokens represented by subsequent layers. Improve quality of dataset / use more data It takes around 30 minutes on one A100 GPU to generate a steering vector from 5000 text pairs. Therefore, I have not yet experimented with using >5000 datapoints for higher accuracy and to reduce bias from confounders. However, it would be interesting to use a more diverse dataset and more datapoints and see whether the steering quality improves.

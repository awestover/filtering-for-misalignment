DeepMind claims that their recent agents learned tool use ; in particular, they learned to build ramps to access inaccessible areas even though none of their training environments contained any inaccessible areas ! This is the result that impresses me most. However, I'm uncertain whether it's really true, or just cherry-picked. Their results showreel depicts multiple instances of the AIs accessing inaccessible areas via ramps and other clever methods. However, in the actual paper page 51, they list all the hand-authored tasks they used to test the agents on, and mention that for some of them the agents did not get >0 reward. One of the tasks that the agents got 0 reward on is: Tool Use Climb 1: The agent must use the objects to reach a higher floor with the target object. So... what gives? They have video of the agents using objects to reach a higher floor containing the target object, multiple separate times. But then in the chart it says failed to achieve reward >0. EDIT: Maybe the paper just has a typo? The blog post contains this image, which appears to show non-zero reward for the "tool use" task, zero-shot:

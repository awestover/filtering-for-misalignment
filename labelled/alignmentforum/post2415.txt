I've already talked about generalised models . The aim is not only to have a universal system for modelling any agent's mental model - universality is pretty easy to get - but a system where it's easy to recreate these mental models. And then analyse the transition between models . This post will show that if there is a morphism r between two models (say, between ideal gas laws and models of atoms bouncing around), then there is an underlying model for that morphism. Specifically, if r is a morphism between M 0 = ( F 0 , Q 0 ) and M 1 = ( F 1 , Q 1 ) , then there is a generalised model M r defined from r . The features of this model are the combination of the features of the two models: F 0 ⊔ F 1 , and there are natural morphisms r 0 and r 1 from this underlying model to M 0 and M 1 : Now, if W 0 and W 1 are the sets of possible worlds for M 0 and M 1 , then W 0 × W 1 is the set of possible worlds for M r . Then since r is a relation between W 0 and W 1 , it can be seen as subset of W 0 × W 1 . And the Q r is a probability distribution over this subset r . What this means is that Q r measures how probability 'flows' from worlds in M 0 to worlds in M 1 . If ( w 0 , w 1 ) is an element of r , then Q r ( w 0 , w 1 ) measures how much probability is flowing from w 0 to w 1 . The actual probability of w 0 is the sum of all probability flowing out of it; that of w 1 , the sum of the probability flowing into it. See for example this diagram, where the Q 0 probabilities are indicated in blue, those of Q r in black, and those of Q 1 in red. The probabilities Q 0 and Q 1 are the sum of the relevant probabilities Q r on the "edges" connecting to those points: The distribution Q r is non-unique, though. The following two examples show situations with the same Q 0 and Q 1 , but different Q r : The rest of this post will be dedicated to prove the existence of the underlying model for the morphism r ; it can be skipped if you aren't interested. Proof of underlying model Definitions Previous posts on generalised models defined them as triplets M = ( F , E , Q ) , with F a set of features, W = 2 ¯ ¯¯ ¯ F the set of possible worlds for those features, E ⊂ W a subset of environments, and Q a probability distribution on E . But E was mainly superfluous, as Q can be extended to a probability distribution on all of W just by setting it to be zero on W − E . Thus E was dropped from the definition. The original definition allowed Q to be a partial probability distribution, but here we'll assume it's a total probability distribution (though not necessarily normalised; Q ( W ) need not be 1 ). The sets of features are assumed to be finite. Then a morphism r between generalised models M 0 = ( F 0 , Q 0 ) and M 1 = ( F 1 , Q 1 ) is a binary relation between W 0 and W 1 , such that: Q 0 ( E 0 ) ≤ Q 1 ( r ( E 0 ) ) , Q 1 ( E 1 ) ≤ Q 0 ( r − 1 ( E 1 ) ) . We might extend the class of morphisms by defining relations that only obey the first inequality as "left-morphisms", and relations that only obey the second one as a "right-morphisms". Left-morphisms ensure probability isn't lost ( Q 1 ( W 1 ) ≥ Q 0 ( W 0 ) ), right morphisms ensure probability isn't gained ( Q 0 ( W 0 ) ≥ Q 1 ( W 1 ) ). Full morphisms, of course, ensure that probability isn't gained or lost ( Q 0 ( W 0 ) = Q 1 ( W 1 ) ). Binary relations are not necessarily functions; functions are relations r such that each w 0 in W 0 is related to exactly one w 1 in W 1 . Statement of the theorem Let r be a morphism between M 0 = ( F 0 , Q 0 ) and M 1 = ( F 1 , Q 1 ) . Then there exists a generalised model M r = ( F 0 ⊔ F 1 , Q r ) , with natural function morphisms r 0 : M r → M 0 and r 1 : M r → M 1 . The Q r is non-zero on a set contained in r ⊂ W 0 × W 1 = 2 F 0 × 2 F 1 = 2 F 0 ⊔ F 1 . The Q r need not be uniquely defined, but the total measure of Q r is the same as Q 0 and Q 1 : Q r ( r ) = Q r ( W 0 × W 1 ) = Q 0 ( W 0 ) = Q 1 ( W 1 ) . Main proof The function r 0 is just projection onto the first component: it sends ( w 0 , w 1 ) to w 0 . The functions r 1 conversely send ( w 0 , w 1 ) to w 1 . Because r 0 and r 1 are functions, they can 'push-forward' any probability distribution Q ′ r on W 0 × W 1 to W 0 and W 1 , respectively. This is given by: r 0 ( Q ′ r ) ( w 0 ) = ∑ w 1 Q r ( w 0 , w 1 ) , and similarly for r 1 ( Q ′ r ) . We aim to construct a Q ′ r such that r 0 ( Q ′ r ) = Q 0 and r 1 ( Q ′ r ) = Q 1 ; this will be our Q r , and will make r 0 and r 1 into morphisms. Define Q ′ r ( w 0 , w 1 ) to be zero if ( w 0 , w 1 ) ∉ r , or Q 0 ( w 0 ) = 0 or Q 1 ( w 1 ) = 0 . Thus we will ignore any elements of W 0 and W 1 of measure zero, and any element of W 0 × W 1 that is not in r . Let w 0 ∈ W 0 be such that it is not related to any elements of w 1 by r . Then Q 0 ( w 0 ) ≤ Q 1 ( r ( w 0 ) ) = Q 1 ( ∅ ) = 0 . Thus any element of W 0 with non-zero measure is related to some w 1 via r . Then define a choice function c that maps every element w 0 with Q 0 ( w 0 ) > 0 , to an element w 1 that it is related to by r . And define Q ′ r ( w 0 , c ( w 0 ) ) = Q 0 ( w 0 ) , and Q ′ r is zero on all other elements of W 0 × W 1 . Then r 0 ( Q ′ r ) ( w 0 ) = ∑ ( w 0 , w 1 ) Q ′ r ( w 0 , w 1 ) = Q ′ r ( w 0 , c ( w 0 ) ) = Q 0 ( w 0 ) . Hence r 0 ( Q ′ r ) = Q 0 . Consequently, Q ′ r ( W 0 × W 1 ) = Q 0 ( W 0 ) . Define Q 0 as the set of Q ′ r , probability distributions on r with r 0 ( Q ′ r ) = Q 0 . We've shown that Q 0 is non-empty; moreover, any Q ′ r ∈ Q 0 has a total measure equal to Q 0 ( W 0 ) = q . Since Q ′ r is defined on r , then it is contained in the set [ 0 , q ] r . The set [ 0 , q ] r is compact, and r 0 ( Q ′ r ) = Q 0 is a closed condition, so Q 0 is compact. The next section will prove that there is an element Q ′ r ∈ Q 0 with r 1 ( Q ′ r ) = Q 1 ; that will complete the proof. Key lemmas Define L ( Q ′ r ) = | r 1 ( Q ′ r ) − Q 1 | 1 = ∑ w 1 ∈ W 1 | r 1 ( Q ′ r ) ( w 1 ) − Q 1 ( w 1 ) | . Now L ( Q ′ r ) ≥ 0 , and note that L ( Q ′ r ) = 0 is equivalent with r 1 ( Q ′ r ) = Q 1 . Thus if L takes the value 0 on Q 0 , we've found the desired Q r . We will show that this happens thanks to the following key lemma: Lemma 1: If there is a Q ′ r ∈ Q 0 with L ( Q ′ r ) > 0 , then there exists a Q ′′ r ∈ Q 0 with L ( Q ′′ r ) < L ( Q ′ r ) . Now, since Q 0 is compact and L is continuous, it will attain its minimum μ on Q 0 . Then lemma 1 shows that μ = 0 (otherwise it wouldn't be a minimum). Proof of Lemma 1: Fix a Q ′ r with L ( Q ′ r ) > 0 . Now r 1 ( Q ′ r ) ( W 1 ) = ∑ ( w 0 , w 1 ) Q ′ r ( w 0 , w 1 ) = r 0 ( Q ′ r ) ( W 0 ) = Q 0 ( W 0 ) = Q 1 ( W 1 ) . So, since L ( Q ′ r ) > 0 , there must exist a w 1 with r 1 ( Q ′ r ) ( w 1 ) > Q 0 ( w 1 ) . By lemma 2 (see below), we'll show that there exists a path ρ n = w 0 1 w 1 0 w 1 1 w 2 0 … w n 0 w n 1 with the following properties: w 0 1 = w 1 , ( w i 0 w i 1 ) and ( w i + 1 0 w i 1 ) are both elements of r , the Q ′ r ( w i + 1 0 w i 1 ) are all greater than 0 , w n 1 is such that r 1 ( Q ′ r ( w n 1 ) ) < Q 1 ( w n 1 ) . Then define ϵ > 0 to be the minimum of { r 1 ( Q ′ r ) ( w 1 ) − Q 1 ( w 1 ) , Q ′ r ( w i 0 w i 1 ) , Q 1 ( w 1 ) − r 1 ( Q ′ r ) ( w n 1 ) } . We'll then define Q ′′ r as Q ′′ r ( w i 0 w i 1 ) = Q ′ r ( w i + 1 0 w i 1 ) − ϵ (which is greater than 0 by the definition of ϵ ), Q ′′ r ( w i 0 w i 1 ) = Q ′ r ( w i 0 w i 1 ) + ϵ , and Q ′′ r = Q r otherwise. Then notice that, apart from w 1 = w 0 1 and w n 1 , r 1 ( Q ′′ r ) ( w i 0 ) = ∑ ( w i 0 , w 1 ) ∈ r Q ′′ r ( w i 0 , w 1 ) = r 1 ( Q ′′ r ) ( w i 0 ) + ϵ − ϵ = r 1 ( Q ′′ r ) ( w i 0 ) . So r ( Q ′ r ) and r ( Q ′′ r ) differ only on w 1 and w n 1 ; specifically r ( Q ′′ r ) ( w 1 ) = r ( Q ′ r ) ( w 1 ) − ϵ , r ( Q ′′ r ) ( w n 1 ) = r ( Q ′ r ) ( w n 1 ) + ϵ . Since r ( Q ′′ r ) ( w 1 ) ≥ Q 1 ( w 1 ) + ϵ and r ( Q ′′ r ) ≤ Q 1 ( w n 1 ) − ϵ , we have L ( Q ′′ r ) = L ( Q ′ r ) − 2 ϵ . This proves Lemma 1. Lemma 2: There exists a path ρ n = w 0 1 w 1 0 w 1 1 w 2 0 … w n 0 w n 1 with the following properties: w 0 1 = w 1 , ( w i 0 w i 1 ) and ( w i + 1 0 w i 1 ) are both elements of r , the Q ′ r ( w i + 1 0 w i 1 ) are all greater than 0 , w n 1 is such that r 1 ( Q ′ r ( w n 1 ) ) < Q 1 ( w n 1 ) . Proof of Lemma 2: Let W 1 ⊂ W 1 be the set of all elements of W 1 that can be reached by paths ρ n (ie are w n 1 ) that obey the first three properties above. Let W 0 ⊂ W 0 be the set of all elements of W 1 that are w n 0 for some path ρ n that obey the first three properties above. Then clearly W 1 = r ( W 0 ) , by the second condition above (note that the third condition doesn't affect ( w n 0 w n 1 ) , which is only required to be in r ). Since r is a morphism, Q 0 ( W 0 ) ≤ Q 1 ( W 1 ) . Note that if Q ′ r ( w 0 , w ′ 1 ) > 0 with w ′ 1 ∈ W 1 , then w 0 must be in W 0 ; this is because we could add w 0 w ′ 1 as w n + 1 0 w n + 1 1 to any path ρ n that reaches w ′ 1 , getting a slightly longer path that goes via w 0 and thus puts it in W 0 . Consequently, r 1 ( Q ′ r ) ( W 1 ) = ∑ ( w ′ 0 , w ′ 1 ) ∈ r , w ′ 1 ∈ W 1 Q ′ r ( w ′ 1 ) = ∑ ( w ′ 0 , w ′ 1 ) ∈ r , w ′ 0 ∈ W 0 Q ′ r ( w ′ 0 ) = Q 0 ( W 0 ) . So r 1 ( Q ′ r ) ( W 1 ) = Q 0 ( W 0 ) ≤ Q 1 ( W 1 ) . Since W 1 includes w 1 with r 1 ( Q ′ r ) ( w 1 ) > Q 1 ( w 1 ) , it also much include at least one w ′′ 1 with r 1 ( Q ′ r ) ( w ′′ 1 ) < Q 1 ( w ′′ 1 ) . The path ρ n that reaches this w ′′ 1 will then satisfy the fourth condition of the lemma, proving it.

I've been tasked by the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy to write their entry on the ethics of AI. I'll be starting the literature reviews and similar in the coming weeks. Could you draw my attention to any aspect of AI ethics (including the history of AI ethics) that you think is important and deserves to be covered? Cheers!

ALTER, with the University of Haifa and the Technion, is excited to announce the details about its upcoming conference introducing AI safety in Israel. Weâ€™re going to be hosting Stuart Russell, as well as several other AI safety researchers, to speak about the field. We're also hosting a number of Israeli academics, who will speak about their related research. The goal of the conference is to build a community of interest around AI safety in Israel, let people know about the field, and following up on the conference, we hope to connect interested attendees with work going on internationally. (This is not intended to be a conference where novel AI safety work is presented, and the primary audience is people who would otherwise be working on AI capabilities research.) If you are, or know anyone who is interested in AI safety in Israel, we would be happy for them to register and attend !

Roman Yampolskiy posted a preprint for "AI Risk Skepticism". Here's the abstract: In this work, we survey skepticism regarding AI risk and show parallels with other types of scientific skepticism. We start by classifying different types of AI Risk skepticism and analyze their root causes. We conclude by suggesting some intervention approaches, which may be successful in reducing AI risk skepticism, at least amongst artificial intelligence researchers. Nothing really new in there to anyone familiar with the field, but seems like a potentially useful list of citations for people coming up to speed on AI safety, and perhaps especially AI policy, and a good summary paper you can reference as evidence that not everyone takes AI risks seriously.

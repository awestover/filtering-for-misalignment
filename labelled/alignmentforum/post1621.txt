Yesterday was the third blog post day at Refine (technically it was announced on Monday for Friday, but people leveraged the week differently so it's in between a week and a day). In the current phase of the incubator we're mostly pushing them to generate and iterate on ideas, with less focus on legibility. This blog post day/week was mainly for pushing them to reach for some feedback, but the program will focus a lot more on legibility in October. Here is the list of blog posts by Refine participants: ordering capability thresholds Refine Blogpost Day #3: The shortforms I did write Levels of goals and alignment Representational Tethers: Tying AI Latents To Human Ones One of the participants is currently trying out more of a research support role, and so didn't write a blog post.

Hello everyone, Wyatt here, the new AIS/G field-builder for Canada. In June I received an EA LTFF fund grant to "connect, expand and enable the AGI Safety & Governance community in Canada", with the goal of making Canada a net positive force on the world stage for transformational AI. We now have a slack server, events calendar, some proposed projects, and a monthly newsletter (coming out this Wednesday), so if you are based in Canada and want to be in the loop, sign up here . Looking forward to the year ahead.

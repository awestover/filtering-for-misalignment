That clickbait-y title is, for once, perfectly accurate: you have until the 31st of August to submit an entry to the Oracle design contest , either a counterfactual or a low bandwidth Oracle. (A note: some of the submissions were done by people who clearly didn't understand how these types of Oracles worked; please check these details before submitting. In particular, any question you ask also has to contain some automated way of checking the Oracle's answer).

This is a YouTube playlist of recorded lectures on the learning-theoretic AI alignment agenda (LTA) I gave for my MATS scholars of the Winter 2024 cohort, edited by my beloved spouse @Marcus Ogren . H/t William Brewer for helping with the recording, and the rest of the MATS team for making this possible. I hope these will become a useful resource for anyone who wants to get up to speed on the LTA, complementary to the reading list . Notable topics that aren't covered include metacognitive agents (although there is an older recorded talk on that) and infra-Bayesian physicalism . In the future, I might record more lectures to expand this playlist. EDIT: I know the audio quality is bad, and I apologize. I will try to do better next time.

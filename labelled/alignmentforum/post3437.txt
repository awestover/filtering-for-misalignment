We are switching hosting providers today from Meteor Galaxy to Amazon AWS (mostly because they have better autoscaling and are cheaper). This will involve a bunch of DNS server changes, and will be the first time we hook up our new autoscaling system to the full brunt of LessWrong traffic, so I expect there will be some problems as we try to calibrate our load balancer and everything. Things should be stable by tonight. Sorry for the inconvenience.

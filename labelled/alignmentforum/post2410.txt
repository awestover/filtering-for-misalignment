The main way we'll be using factored sets is as a foundation for talking about concepts like orthogonality and time. Finite factored sets will play a role that's analogous to that of directed acyclic graphs in Pearlian causal inference. To utilize factored sets in this way, we will first want to introduce the concept of generating a partition with factors. 3.1. Generating a Partition with Factors Definition 16 (generating a partition). Given a finite factored set F = ( S , B ) , a partition X ∈ P a r t ( S ) , and a C ⊆ B , we say C generates X (in F ), written C ⊢ F X , if χ F C ( x , S ) = x for all x ∈ X . The following proposition gives many equivalent definitions of ⊢ F . Proposition 10 . Let F = ( S , B ) be a finite factored set, let X ∈ P a r t ( S ) be a partition of S , and let C be a subset of B . The following are equivalent: C ⊢ F X . χ F C ( x , S ) = x for all x ∈ X . χ F C ( x , S ) ⊆ x for all x ∈ X . χ F C ( x , y ) ⊆ x for all x , y ∈ X . χ F C ( s , t ) ∈ [ s ] X for all s , t ∈ S . χ F C ( s , t ) ∼ X s for all s , t ∈ S . X ≤ S ⋁ S ( C ) . Proof. The equivalence of conditions 1 and 2 is by definition. The equivalence of conditions 2 and 3 follows directly from the fact that χ F C ( s , s ) = s for all s ∈ x , so χ F C ( x , S ) ⊇ χ F C ( x , x ) ⊇ x . To see that conditions 3 and 4 are equivalent, observe that since S = ⋃ y ∈ X y , χ F C ( x , S ) = ⋃ y ∈ X χ F C ( x , y ) . Thus, if χ F C ( x , S ) ⊆ x , χ F C ( x , y ) ⊆ x for all y ∈ X , and conversely if χ F C ( x , y ) ⊆ x for all y ∈ X , then χ F C ( x , S ) ⊆ x . To see that condition 3 is equivalent to condition 5, observe that if condition 5 holds, then for all x ∈ X , we have χ F C ( s , t ) ∈ [ s ] X = x for all s ∈ x and t ∈ S . Thus χ F C ( x , S ) ⊆ x . Conversely, if condition 3 holds, χ F C ( s , t ) ∈ χ F C ( [ s ] X , S ) ⊆ [ s ] X for all s , t ∈ S . Condition 6 is clearly a trivial restatement of condition 5. To see that conditions 6 and 7 are equivalent, observe that if condition 6 holds, and s , t ∈ S satisfy s ∼ ⋁ S ( C ) t , then χ F C ( s , t ) = t , so t = χ F C ( s , t ) ∼ X s . Thus X ≤ S ⋁ S ( C ) . Conversely, if condition 7 holds, then since χ F C ( s , t ) ∼ ⋁ S ( C ) s for all s , t ∈ S , we have χ F C ( s , t ) ∼ X s . □ Here are some basic properties of ⊢ F . Proposition 11 . Let F = ( S , B ) be a finite factored set, let C and D be subsets of B , and let X , Y ∈ P a r t ( S ) be partitions of S . If X ≤ S Y and C ⊢ F Y , then C ⊢ F X . If C ⊢ F X and C ⊢ F Y , then C ⊢ F X ∨ S Y . B ⊢ F X . { } ⊢ F X if and only if X = Ind S . If C ⊆ D and C ⊢ F X , then D ⊢ F X . If C ⊢ F X and D ⊢ F X , then C ∩ D ⊢ F X . Proof. For the first 5 parts, we will use the equivalent definition from Proposition 10 that C ⊢ F X if and only if X ≤ S ⋁ S ( C ) . Then 1 follows directly from the transitivity of ≤ S . 2 follows directly from the fact that any partition Z satisfies X ∨ S Y ≤ Z if and only if X ≤ Z and Y ≤ Z . 3 follows directly from the fact that ⋁ S ( B ) = Dis S by Proposition 3 . 4 follows directly from the fact that ⋁ S ( { } ) = Ind S , together with the fact that X ≤ S Ind S if and only if X = Ind S . 5 follows directly from the fact that if C ⊆ D , then ⋁ S ( C ) ≤ ⋁ S ( D ) . Finally, we need to prove part 6. For this, we will use the equivalent definition from Proposition 10 that C ⊢ F X if and only if χ F C ( s , t ) ∼ X s for all s , t ∈ S . Assume that for all s , t ∈ S , χ F C ( s , t ) ∼ X s and χ F D ( s , t ) ∼ X s . Thus, for all s , t ∈ S , χ F C ∩ D ( s , t ) = χ F C ( χ F D ( s , t ) , t ) ∼ X χ F D ( s , t ) ∼ X s . Thus C ∩ D ⊢ F X . □ Our main use of ⊢ F will be in the definition of the history of a partition. 3.2. History Definition 17 (history of a partition). Given a finite factored set F = ( S , B ) and a partition X ∈ P a r t ( S ) , let h F ( X ) denote the smallest (according to the subset ordering) subset of B such that h F ( X ) ⊢ F X . The history of X , then, is the smallest set of factors C ⊆ B such that if you're trying to figure out which part in X any given s ∈ S is in, it suffices to know what part s is in within each of the factors in C . We can informally think of h F ( X ) as the smallest amount of information needed to compute X . Proposition 12 . Given a finite factored set F = ( S , B ) , and a partition X ∈ P a r t ( S ) , h F ( X ) is well-defined. Proof. Fix a finite factored set F = ( S , B ) and a partition X ∈ P a r t ( S ) , and let h F ( X ) be the intersection of all C ⊆ B such that C ⊢ F X . It suffices to show that h F ( X ) ⊢ F X ; then h F ( X ) will clearly be the unique smallest (according to the subset ordering) subset of B such that h F ( X ) ⊢ F X . Note that h F ( X ) is a finite intersection, since there are only finitely many subsets of B , and that h F ( X ) is an intersection of a nonempty collection of sets since B ⊢ F X . Thus, we can express h F ( X ) as a composition of finitely many binary intersections. By part 6 of Proposition 11, the intersection of two subsets that generate X also generates X . Thus h F ( X ) ⊢ F X . □ Here are some basic properties of history. Proposition 13 . Let F = ( S , B ) be a finite factored set, and let X , Y ∈ P a r t ( S ) be partitions of S . If X ≤ S Y , then h F ( X ) ⊆ h F ( Y ) . h F ( X ∨ S Y ) = h F ( X ) ∪ h F ( Y ) . h F ( X ) = { } if and only if X = Ind S . If S is nonempty, then h F ( b ) = { b } for all b ∈ B . Proof. The first 3 parts are trivial consequences of history's definition and Proposition 11. For the fourth part, observe that { b } ⊢ F b by condition 7 of Proposition 10. b is nontrivial, and since S is nonempty, b is nonempty. So we have ¬ ( { } ⊢ F b ) by part 4 of Proposition 11. Thus { b } is the smallest subset of B that generates b . □ 3.3. Orthogonality We are now ready to define the notion of orthogonality between two partitions of S . Definition 18 (orthogonality). Given a finite factored set F = ( S , B ) and partitions X , Y ∈ P a r t ( S ) , we say X is orthogonal to Y (in F ), written X ⊥ F Y , if h F ( X ) ∩ h F ( Y ) = { } . If ¬ ( X ⊥ F Y ) , we say X is entangled with Y (in F ). We could also unpack this definition to not mention history or chimera functions. Proposition 14 . Given a finite factored set F = ( S , B ) , and partitions X , Y ∈ P a r t ( S ) , X ⊥ F Y if and only if there exists a C ⊆ B such that X ≤ S ⋁ S ( C ) and Y ≤ S ⋁ S ( B ∖ C ) . Proof. If there exists a C ⊆ B such that X ≤ S ⋁ S ( C ) and Y ≤ S ⋁ S ( B ∖ C ) , then C ⊢ F X and B ∖ C ⊢ F Y . Thus, h F ( X ) ⊆ C and h F ( Y ) ⊆ B ∖ C , so h F ( X ) ∩ h F ( Y ) = { } . Conversely, if h F ( X ) ∩ h F ( Y ) = { } , let C = h F ( X ) . Then C ⊢ F X , so X ≤ S ⋁ S ( C ) , and B ∖ C ⊇ h F ( Y ) , so B ∖ C ⊢ F Y , so Y ≤ S ⋁ S ( B ∖ C ) . □ Here are some basic properties of orthogonality. Proposition 15 . Let F = ( S , B ) be a finite factored set, and let X , Y , Z ∈ P a r t ( S ) be partitions of S . If X ⊥ F Y , then Y ⊥ F X . If X ⊥ F Z and Y ≤ S X , then Y ⊥ F Z . If X ⊥ F Z and Y ⊥ F Z , then ( X ∨ S Y ) ⊥ F Z . X ⊥ F X if and only if X = Ind S . Proof. Part 1 is trivial from the symmetry in the definition. Parts 2, 3, and 4 follow directly from Proposition 13. □ 3.4. Time Finally, we can define our notion of time in a factored set. Definition 19 ((strictly) before). Given a finite factored set F = ( S , B ) , and partitions X , Y ∈ P a r t ( S ) , we say X is before Y (in F ), written X ≤ F Y , if h F ( X ) ⊆ h F ( Y ) . We say X is strictly before Y (in F ), written X < F Y , if h F ( X ) ⊂ h F ( Y ) . Again, we could also unpack this definition to not mention history or chimera functions. Proposition 16 . Given a finite factored set F = ( S , B ) , and partitions X , Y ∈ P a r t ( S ) , X ≤ F Y if and only if every C ⊆ B satisfying Y ≤ S ⋁ S ( C ) also satisfies X ≤ S ⋁ S ( C ) . Proof. Note that by part 7 of Proposition 10, part 5 of Proposition 11, and the definition of history, C satisfies Y ≤ S ⋁ S ( C ) if and only if C ⊇ h F ( Y ) , and similarly for X . Clearly, if h F ( Y ) ⊇ h F ( X ) , every C ⊇ h F ( Y ) satisfies C ⊇ h F ( X ) . Conversely, if h F ( X ) is not a subset of h F ( Y ) , then we can take C = h F ( Y ) , and observe that C ⊇ h F ( Y ) but not C ⊇ h F ( X ) . □ Interestingly, we can also define time entirely as a closure property of orthogonality. We hold that the philosophical interpretation of time as a closure property on orthogonality is natural and transcends the ontology set up in this sequence. Proposition 17 . Given a finite factored set F = ( S , B ) , and partitions X , Y ∈ P a r t ( S ) , X ≤ F Y if and only if every Z ∈ P a r t ( S ) satisfying Y ⊥ F Z also satisfies X ⊥ F Z . Proof. Clearly if h F ( X ) ⊆ h F ( Y ) , then every Z satisfying h F ( Y ) ∩ h F ( Z ) = { } also satisfies h F ( X ) ∩ h F ( Z ) = { } . Conversely, if h F ( X ) is not a subset of h F ( Y ) , let b ∈ B be an element of h F ( X ) that is not in h F ( Y ) . Assuming S is nonempty, b is nonempty, so we have h F ( b ) = { b } , so Y ⊥ F b , but not X ⊥ F b . On the other hand, if S is empty, then X = Y = { } , so clearly X ≤ F Y . □ Here are some basic properties of time. Proposition 18 . Let F = ( S , B ) be a finite factored set, and let X , Y , Z ∈ P a r t ( S ) be partitions of S . X ≤ F X . If X ≤ F Y and Y ≤ F Z , then X ≤ F Z . If X ≤ S Y , then X ≤ F Y . If X ≤ F Z and Y ≤ F Z , then ( X ∨ S Y ) ≤ F Z . Proof. Part 1 is trivial from the definition. Part 2 is trivial by transitivity of the subset relation. Part 3 follows directly from part 1 of Proposition 13. Part 4 follows directly from part 2 of Proposition 13. □ Finally, note that we can (circularly) redefine history in terms of time, thus partially justifying the names. Proposition 19 . Given a nonempty finite factored set F = ( S , B ) and a partition X ∈ P a r t ( S ) , h F ( X ) = { b ∈ B ∣ b ≤ F X } . Proof. Since S is nonempty, part 4 of Proposition 13 says that h F ( b ) = { b } for all b ∈ B . Thus { b ∈ B ∣ b ≤ F X } = { b ∈ B ∣ { b } ⊆ h F ( X ) } = { b ∈ B ∣ b ∈ h F ( X ) } = h F ( X ) . □ In the next post, we'll build up to a definition of conditional orthogonality by introducing the notion of subpartitions.

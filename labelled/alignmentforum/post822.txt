Since this still seems to be an area of active debate within the ML community, it may be worthwhile providing a location to gather this evidence all in one place. Please only list one paper per answer as that makes it easier for people to comment on it (and possibly critique the evidence). Also feel free to include evidence of them not containing world models.

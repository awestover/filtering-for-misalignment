Your AI’s training data might make it more “evil” and more able to circumvent your security, monitoring, and control measures. Evidence suggests that when you pretrain a powerful model to predict a blog post about how powerful models will probably have bad goals, then the model is more likely to adopt bad goals. I discuss ways to test for and mitigate these potential mechanisms. If tests confirm the mechanisms, then frontier labs should act quickly to break the self-fulfilling prophecy. Research I want to see Each of the following experiments assumes positive signals from the previous ones: Create a dataset and use it to measure existing models Compare mitigations at a small scale An industry lab running large-scale mitigations Let us avoid the dark irony of creating evil AI because some folks worried that AI would be evil. If self-fulfilling misalignment has a strong effect, then we should act. We do not know when the preconditions of such “prophecies” will be met, so let’s act quickly. https://turntrout.com/self-fulfilling-misalignment

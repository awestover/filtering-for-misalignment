I've been thinking recently and writing a post about potential AGI architecture that seems possible to make with current technology in 3 to 5 years, and even faster if significant effort will be put to that goal. It is a bold claim, and that architecture very well might not be feasible, but it got me thinking about the memetic hazard of similar posts. It might very well be true that there is an architecture combining current AI tech in a manner as to create AGI out there; in that case, should we treat it as a memetic hazard? If so, what is the course of action here? I'm thinking that the best thing to do is to covertly discuss it with the AI Safety crowd, both to understand it's feasibility, and to start working on how to keep this particular architecture aligned (which is a much easier task than aligning something that you don't even know how it will look.) What are your thoughts on this matter?

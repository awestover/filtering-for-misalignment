Back in April, Google AI announced SayCan , a project which integrated a language model (FLAN) with robotics in order to produce a robot which could follow instructions. For example, cleaning up a mess in a kitchen. ( LessWrong post from April which links to a tweet about SayCan.) This week Google AI has released some new updates, dubbed PaLM-SayCan. This involved upgrading the integrated language model to Google AI's top performing large language model (LLM) of 540-billion parameters, PaLM. Website for PaLM-SayCan Blog post announcing PaLM-SayCan The following updates from this week are quoted from the original SayCan project website (linked in first sentence of this post, bold mine): [8/16/2022] We integrated SayCan with Pathways Language Model (PaLM) , and updated the results. We also added new capabilities including drawer manipulation, chain of thought prompting and multilingual instructions. You can see all the new results in the updated paper . [8/16/2022] Our updated results show that SayCan combined with the improved language model (PaLM), which we refer to as PaLM-SayCan, improves the robotics performance of the entire system compared to a previous LLM (FLAN). PaLM-SayCan chooses the correct sequence of skills 84% of the time and executes them successfully 74% of the time, reducing errors by a half compared to FLAN . This is particularly exciting because it represents the first time we can see how an improvement in language models translates to a similar improvement in robotics. [8/16/2022] We open-sourced a version of SayCan on a simulated tabletop environment. Thanks to Jon Menaster for making me aware of this update from Google AI.

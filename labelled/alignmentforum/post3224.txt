The MIRI Summer Fellows Program is having a writing day, where the participants are given a whole day to write whatever LessWrong / AI Alignment Forum posts that they like. This is to practice the skills needed for forum participation as a research strategy . On an average day LessWrong gets about 5-6 posts, but last year this generated 28 posts . It's likely this will happen again, starting mid-to-late afternoon PDT. It's pretty overwhelming to try to read-and-comment on 28 posts in a day, so we're gonna make sure this isn't the only chance you'll have to interact with these posts. In the coming weeks I'll post roundups, highlighting 3-5 of the posts, giving them a second airing for comments and discussion.

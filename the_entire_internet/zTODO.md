- Separate out the link obtaining from the downloading. 
link obtaining should happen with Brave API, Then later I can download the stuff somehow. probably using the requests library.

- Probably there is some smarter way to download from Arxiv -- maybe there already exists a scrape somewhere? 

- My method of scraping text from pdfs seems to not be working. 
- Also, pretty sure I was getting blocked by Arxiv and researchgate at least, so may need to further increase wait times. 
Perhaps I can rent multiple machines to decrease serial time? 

Hopefully one of my collaborators can do this!
